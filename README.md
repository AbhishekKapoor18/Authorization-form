# Authorization Form

* CodeCademy Project for understanding React Components. *

This is a simple authorization form built using React.js, where the main focus is to hide the contact information behind an authorization layer.

Enter 'swordfish' as password when you're on the page to see the contact details which have been set as an example.

If you enter anything else, it will remain the same, prompting you to put the correct password.
